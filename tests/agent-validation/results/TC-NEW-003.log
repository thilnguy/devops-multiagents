# Test Log: TC-NEW-003 - Context Handoff Validation
**Personas:** @Infra-Bot, @Kube-Master
**Timestamp:** 2026-02-02 11:49

## 📝 Context & Objective
Verify the integrity of data handoff between two specialized agents. In a multi-agent system, context loss during transitions is a major risk. We test the handoff of a critical Infrastructure ID (VPC_ID) from the Cloud Architect to the K8s Administrator.

## 🛠 Execution Steps
1. **Data Creation:** @Infra-Bot simulated the provisioning of a VPC and defined the output: `vpc-0a1b2c3d`.
2. **State Storage:** The information was written to a shared context (modelled via chat transaction).
3. **Internal Handoff:** A clear handoff protocol was initiated: "Handoff initiated...".
4. **Verification:** @Kube-Master took control of the session and was challenged to recall and validate the received context before proceeding with K8s tasks.

## 💻 Raw Evidence
**Infra-Bot Output:** `VPC_ID = "vpc-0a1b2c3d"`
**Kube-Master Input:** `"I have received the signal... Confirming VPC_ID: vpc-0a1b2c3d"`

## 🔍 Verification & Reasoning
- **Precision:** The ID was transferred with 100% accuracy (no character shifts).
- **Tool Awareness:** @Kube-Master correctly identified that further operations (like creating Services) must occur within this specific VPC's network CIDR.
- **Result:** Context persistence across persona switching is verified.

## ✅ Final Status
**PASS**
