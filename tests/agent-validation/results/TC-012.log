# Test Log: TC-012 - Incident Response & Automated Hotfix
**Personas:** @Kube-Master, @Master-Architect
**Timestamp:** 2026-02-01 11:30

## 📝 Context & Objective
Simulate a "Production Outage" and measure the time it takes for the Multi-Agent system to detect, diagnose, and fix the issue (MTTR - Mean Time to Repair).

## 🛠 Execution Steps
1. **The Sabotage:** User injected a broken image into the live `sample-api`.
2. **Detection:** @Kube-Master detected the `CrashLoopBackOff` within 5 seconds.
3. **Alerting:** Notified @Master-Architect of the critical failure.
4. **Diagnosis:** Identified the bad image tag in the deployment spec.
5. **Fix Execution:** @Kube-Master automatically rolled back the image to the last known-good version.
6. **Validation:** Verified the service returned to `Running` state.

## 💻 Raw Evidence
**MTTR:** ~25 seconds (from injection to fix).
**Resolution Logs:** `deployment.apps/sample-api image updated to nginx:alpine`
**Status:** `Service UP`

## 🔍 Verification & Reasoning
- **Autonomous Recovery:** The Agent demonstrated it can fix production issues without waiting for human intervention, while still keeping the human informed through the chat.
- **Speed:** The reaction time is significantly faster than any human operator could achieve.

## ✅ Final Status
**PASS**
