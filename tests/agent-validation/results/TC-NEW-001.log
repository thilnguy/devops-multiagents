# Test Log: TC-NEW-001 - User Command Verification
**Persona:** @Master-Architect
**Timestamp:** 2026-02-02 11:44

## 📝 Context & Objective
The objective of this test is to implement a Zero-Trust verification mechanism between the Agent and the User. This ensures that CLI commands are actually executed on the host system and the output provided to the Agent is authentic, not hallucinated or spoofed.

## 🛠 Execution Steps
1. **Nonce Generation:** @Master-Architect generated a unique, session-specific Execution ID: `exec-v21-tc001`.
2. **Command Issuance:** The Agent requested the User to execute a specific command string that appends the Verification ID using an `echo`.
3. **Execution:** The User ran the command in the local terminal.
4. **Verification:** The Agent parsed the terminal output to confirm the presence and correctness of the Nonce.

## 💻 Raw Evidence
**Command:** 
`kubectl get nodes --no-headers && echo "VERIFY:exec-v21-tc001"`

**Output:**
```text
docker-desktop   Ready   control-plane   3d4h   v1.32.2
VERIFY:exec-v21-tc001
```

## 🔍 Verification & Reasoning
- **Nonce Match:** The output contained `VERIFY:exec-v21-tc001`, which exactly matches the challenge issued by the Agent.
- **Data Consistency:** The system data (Node: docker-desktop, Version: v1.32.2) is consistent with the known environment state.
- **Security Conclusion:** The Agent successfully validated that it is communicating with a live, authorized terminal session.

## ✅ Final Status
**PASS**
