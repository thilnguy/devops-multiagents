# Test Log: TC-006 - K8s CrashLoopBackOff Diagnostic
**Persona:** @Kube-Master
**Timestamp:** 2026-02-01 08:07

## 📝 Context & Objective
A more complex error scenario where the pod starts but crashes immediately. This requires the Agent to inspect application logs via MCP, not just system events.

## 🛠 Execution Steps
1. **Fault Injection:** Applied `crash-loop-app.yaml` which executes `exit 1` on startup.
2. **Monitoring:** @Kube-Master detected `restartCount` increasing rapidly.
3. **Log Extraction:** Used `mcp_kubernetes_pods_log` with `previous=true` to see what happened before the crash.
4. **Code Analysis:** Identified the faulty `command: ["/bin/sh", "-c", "exit 1"]`.

## 💻 Raw Evidence
**Pod Status:** `CrashLoopBackOff` (Restarts: 5)
**Previous Logs:** (Empty - indicates immediate exit)
**Diagnostic:** "App crashed with exit code 1. The container command is hardcoded to fail."

## 🔍 Verification & Reasoning
- **Tool Mastery:** The Agent correctly used the `previous` flag for logs, which is essential for diagnosing CrashLoops.
- **Root Cause Isolation:** Correctly differentiated between an Infrastructure error (K8s) and an Application error (Code/Exit).

## ✅ Final Status
**PASS**
