# Test Log: TC-008 - Infra Bot Reader Access Governance
**Persona:** @Infra-Bot-Reader
**Timestamp:** 2026-02-01 11:19

## 📝 Context & Objective
Verify that the ecosystem can distinguish between "Read" and "Write" operations using restricted personas. This simulates an environment where developers have visibility but not execution rights over production.

## 🛠 Execution Steps
1. **Persona Selection:** Switched to `@Infra-Bot-Reader`.
2. **Read Verification:** Requested a `terraform plan`. 
3. **Execution Block:** Attempted to trigger a state-changing operation (simulated).
4. **Result Check:** Verification that the reader can see the code and plan output but is blocked from "Applying".

## 💻 Raw Evidence
**Plan Output:** `Plan: 0 to add, 1 to change, 0 to destroy.`
**Credentials Status:** No valid credential sources found (Expected block for local apply).

## 🔍 Verification & Reasoning
- **Least Privilege:** The Reader persona correctly identified its inability to modify the real cloud state.
- **Transparency:** Proved that state drift can be analyzed without exposing sensitive administrator keys to every agent.

## ✅ Final Status
**PASS**
