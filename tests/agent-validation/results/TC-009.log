# Test Log: TC-009 - Pipe-Liner Jenkins Connectivity
**Persona:** @Pipe-Liner
**Timestamp:** 2026-02-01 11:17

## 📝 Context & Objective
Validate the Agent's ability to interact with CI/CD platforms via MCP. Jenkins is a primary tool for our automation pipeline, so successful authentication and job discovery are critical.

## 🛠 Execution Steps
1. **Handshake:** @Pipe-Liner used `mcp_jenkins_whoAmI` to verify the connection.
2. **Access Control:** Confirmed the agent is logged in as `admin`.
3. **Environment Scan:** Searched for existing pipelines using `mcp_jenkins_getJobs`.
4. **Status Check:** Confirmed Jenkins is healthy and responsive.

## 💻 Raw Evidence
**Jenkins User:** `admin`
**Job Count:** `0` (Confirmed fresh installation)
**Connection:** `Success`

## 🔍 Verification & Reasoning
- **Protocol Validation:** The Jenkins MCP server is correctly configured and reachable by the Agentic layer.
- **Ready-for-Op:** The system is primed to start creating and triggering CI/CD jobs.

## ✅ Final Status
**PASS**
