# Test Log: TC-004 - Sample App Deployment & Quota Validation
**Persona:** @Kube-Master
**Timestamp:** 2026-02-01 07:51

## 📝 Context & Objective
Test the interaction between Pod specs and Namespace ResourceQuotas. This is a common point of failure in K8s clusters where users forget to define resource `requests` and `limits`.

## 🛠 Execution Steps
1. **Initial Deployment:** A minimal Nginx pod was deployed without resource definitions.
2. **Failure Analysis:** The deployment failed with a Quota error. @Kube-Master intercepted the error.
3. **Problem Solving:** The Agent identified that `ResourceQuota` requires explicit resource requests.
4. **Fix Implementation:** The Agent deployed a `LimitRange` to automate default resource injection.

## 💻 Raw Evidence
**Error Message:** `failed quota: sandbox-quota: must specify requests.cpu,requests.memory`
**Resolution:** Applied `LimitRange` for `devops-sandbox`.
**Final Result:** `pod/nginx-6799fc88d8-xxxxx` status changed to `Running`.

## 🔍 Verification & Reasoning
- **Expertise:** The Agent demonstrated advanced K8s knowledge by proposing `LimitRange` as a global fix instead of just patching one Pod.
- **Stability:** Confirmed that the "Safe Haven" (Sandbox) is now user-friendly while remaining constrained.

## ✅ Final Status
**PASS**
