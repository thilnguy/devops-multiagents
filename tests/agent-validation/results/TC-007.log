# Test Log: TC-007 - Terraform Error Detection & Pair Programming
**Persona:** @Infra-Bot
**Timestamp:** 2026-02-01 08:15

## 📝 Context & Objective
Test the Agent's ability to debug HCL (HashiCorp Configuration Language) and act as a proactive "Coding Assistant" for infrastructure developers.

## 🛠 Execution Steps
1. **Fault Injection:** User created `test-invalid.tf` with a missing bracket and a fake attribute.
2. **Scan:** @Infra-Bot scanned the directory and identified the new file.
3. **Parsing:** The Agent mentally "parsed" the file and compared it against the AWS provider schema.
4. **Correction:** Provided a corrected snippet and explained the syntax rules.

## 💻 Raw Evidence
**Error 1:** Missing `}` on line 7.
**Error 2:** `invalid_attribute` is not a valid argument for `aws_security_group`.
**Recommendation:** Renamed `invalid_attribute` to `description`.

## 🔍 Verification & Reasoning
- **Schema Awareness:** The Agent did not just find syntax errors, but also logic errors (invalid attributes) using its internal knowledge of the AWS provider.
- **UX:** The feedback was constructive, not just critical.

## ✅ Final Status
**PASS**
