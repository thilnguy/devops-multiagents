# Test Log: TC-NEW-007 - Partial Failure Recovery
**Persona:** @Kube-Master
**Timestamp:** 2026-02-02 12:25

## 📝 Context & Objective
Verify the system's "Idempotency" and ability to recover from "Partial Failures". In real-world DevOps, network timeouts often cause a sequence of resource creations to fail halfway. The Agent should be able to retry and only complete the missing pieces.

## 🛠 Execution Steps
1. **Foundation:** Created a new namespace `partial-fail-reco`.
2. **First Attempt (Success part):** Successfully created a Deployment.
3. **Simulated Failure:** Failed at the Service creation step.
4. **Recovery Attempt:** Issued a command to apply BOTH resources again.
5. **Observation:** Monitoring if the existing Deployment is duplicated or errored.

## 💻 Raw Evidence (MCP Logs)
**Namespace:** `partial-fail-reco` (Active)
**Deployment:** `test-idemp-deploy` (Already Exists - Status: Unchanged)
**Service:** `test-idemp-svc` (Created successfully in 2nd attempt)

## 🔍 Verification & Reasoning
- **Idempotency:** The Kubernetes API and the Agent cooperated to recognize the existing deployment and skip it without error.
- **State Convergence:** After the retry, the final state matched the desired state (1 Namespace, 1 Deployment, 1 Service).
- **Resilience:** The Agent successfully managed the "Resume" logic after a failure.

## ✅ Final Status
**PASS**
