# Test Log: TC-NEW-008 - Brownfield Update Operations
**Persona:** @Kube-Master
**Timestamp:** 2026-02-02 12:16

## 📝 Context & Objective
Verify the ability to perform a **Zero-Downtime Rolling Update** on an existing (brownfield) application. The Agent must monitor the transition and ensure that at no point is the service unavailable.

## 🛠 Execution Steps
1. **Status Quo:** A `sample-api` deployment exists with 2 healthy replicas (v1: `nginx:alpine`).
2. **The Update:** @Kube-Master issued an update to version v2 (`nginx:1.25-alpine`).
3. **Traffic Management:** Configured `maxSurge: 1` and `maxUnavailable: 0` to ensure stability.
4. **Real-time Monitoring:** The Agent polled the Pod status via MCP every few seconds during the rollout.

## 💻 Raw Evidence (Monitoring Sequence)
- **T+0s:** Progressing (2 old ready, 1 new creating). Total: 3.
- **T+44s:** `sample-api-fdb98c...` (New Pod) is ready. Old pod termination initiated.
- **T+110s:** 2 new pods Ready. All old pods removed.

## 🔍 Verification & Reasoning
- **Availability:** At all times, `ReadyReplicas` was >= 2. No downtime occurred.
- **Rollout Integrity:** The `observedGeneration` was updated to the new spec version.
- **Observability:** The Agent correctly interpreted the `Pod-template-hash` changes to track the transition.

## ✅ Final Status
**PASS**
