# Test Log: TC-011 - Full Stack Multi-Agent Coordination
**Personas:** @Master-Architect -> @Infra-Bot -> @Kube-Master
**Timestamp:** 2026-02-01 11:28

## 📝 Context & Objective
This is the "Golden Path" test. It validates the end-to-end flow of creating a full-stack component where three different personas must hand off tasks to each other.

## 🛠 Execution Steps
1. **Architectural Intent:** @Master-Architect defined the requirement for a resilient API service.
2. **Infrastructure Handoff:** @Infra-Bot validated the AWS VPC requirements and defined the network context.
3. **K8s Implementation:** @Kube-Master took the refined context and deployed the Namespace, Deployment, and Service.
4. **Final Review:** @Master-Architect performed a health check on the deployed Service.

## 💻 Raw Evidence
**Sequence:** Infra Registry Check -> K8s Namespace Create -> K8s Deployment -> K8s Service -> Pod Running.
**Final Architecture:** 1 Service (LB) pointing to 2 Pods (Nginx) across a managed Namespace.

## 🔍 Verification & Reasoning
- **Synergy:** The agents did not contradict each other; they built upon the previous agent's work.
- **Context Retention:** The requirement "Resilient API" was maintained through the entire chain (translated to 2 replicas and health probes).

## ✅ Final Status
**PASS**
